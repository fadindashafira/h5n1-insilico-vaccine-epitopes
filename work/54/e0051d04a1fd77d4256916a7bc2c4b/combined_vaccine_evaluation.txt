Notes:
- This evaluation was performed using optimized tools:
  * BioPython ProtParam for physicochemical properties
  * IEDB API for antigenicity prediction
  * Rule-based model for allergenicity assessment
- For 3D structure prediction, please use the generated FASTA file with Google Colab and ColabFold:
  * Upload the file 'combined_vaccine_for_colabfold.fasta' to Google Drive
  * Use a ColabFold notebook for structure prediction
- For a more comprehensive evaluation, consider:
  1. Experimental validation of immunogenicity
  2. Testing against diverse HLA alleles
  3. Comparison with known effective vaccine epitopes
